TimeIT is a time tracker that works quietly almost without
any interaction and still measures the time you are spending 
on several projects. The concept of this program is that tasks
and projects are assigned to workspaces and while you are in 
those workspaces your projects are timed. 

It features workspace tracking, idle detection, editing of 
time records and has summary views grouped by day, week, month,
and year.
